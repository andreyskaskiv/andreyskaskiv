### :man_technologist: About me:

I am a beginner Python developer <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="30px">.
My journey in IT began with developing strategies for cryptocurrency trading. I tried my hand at data science, and then
I dove into the world of backend development. I enjoyed understanding the business logic of the product, improving
performance, reducing response time and resource consumption. Now, I am also passionate about pentesting, which allows
me to see web applications from different angles and enriches my experience.
